Workspace: template

Learnings:
- The home page (`apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx`) renders a resume section inline; adding UI below it is best done within this file to keep sections cohesive.
- `Separator` from `@/components/ui` is used between major sections; follow this for visual rhythm.
- Lint rules enforce multi-line anchors and disallow unused variables; keep added markup formatted and avoid introducing unused vars.

Helpful in:
- Adding small UI sections to the home page without creating new shared components.
- Ensuring anchors and minor UI follow the project's formatting and class naming conventions.
- Resume data now comes from Convex via `api.resume.getProfile`; rely on Convex schemas for field names and keep variants in the database, not static files.
- When adding tests for Convex-backed hooks, mock both `useSearch` and `useQuery`, and stub the namespace in `@template/convex` as needed.
- Maintain resume variant content in `apps/convex/convex/resumeData.ts`, update copy there (e.g., investor notes for HEAT), and rerun `npx convex dev` + `npx convex run seed:seed` to refresh the deployment data.
- Use `replaceProfilesData` in `apps/convex/convex/resume.ts` when seeding or mutating batches; avoid calling Convex functions from other Convex functions (no `.handler` chaining).
- Control resume job ordering by adjusting the `priority` field in `resumeProjects` for each slug; lower priority values surface first after reseeding.
- Add credential highlights via `resumeSkills` entries (e.g., `Credentials` category) instead of profile summaries when noting education or certifications.
