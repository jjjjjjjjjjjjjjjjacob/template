Task: Add footer after resume section on the home page

Status: Completed

What I did:
- Added a local `SiteFooter` component in `apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx`.
- Rendered it after the resume section with a visual `Separator` above it.
- Footer contains copyright line and quick anchors for `#projects` and `#resume`.

What to do next (if needed):
- Consider extracting `SiteFooter` into a shared component if used across routes.
- Optionally add social/profile links and a "back to top" link.
- If the standalone resume route (`apps/web/src/routes/resume.tsx`) needs a footer too, add a similar footer there.
