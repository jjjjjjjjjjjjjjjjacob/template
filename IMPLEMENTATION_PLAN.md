# Implementation Plan: Template Repository Updates from Vibechecc

## Overview

This shared progress tracker coordinates the systematic incorporation of improvements from the vibechecc repository into the template repository. All subagents should reference and update this document when working on related tasks.

**Purpose**: This document serves as a central coordination point for all AI agents working on template improvements. It tracks progress, dependencies, and completion status across all phases.

## Progress Tracking Guidelines for Subagents

### Task Status Markers

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[🔄]` - In progress (agent actively working)
- `[✅]` - Completed and verified
- `[⚠️]` - Blocked or needs attention
- `[🔍]` - Under review/testing

### Agent Communication Protocol

- Add notes in `<!-- Agent: [agent-type] Note: [message] -->` format
- Update completion percentage for each phase
- Log work sessions with: `<!-- Session: [agent-type] Tasks: [task-ids] Status: [summary] -->`
- Mark dependencies clearly when blocking other tasks

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Breaking Changes**: Create feature flags for gradual rollout
2. **Performance Regression**: Monitor metrics before/after each phase
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Test across all supported browsers
4. **Developer Adoption**: Provide migration guides and training

## Implementation Notes for Agents

### Working Principles

- **Incremental Progress**: Complete small, testable chunks rather than entire phases
- **Continuous Testing**: Verify each change before marking complete
- **Documentation**: Update `.agent/docs/` with learnings after each work session
- **Compatibility**: Always maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly noted
- **Communication**: Use the coordination log to communicate with other agents

### Branch Strategy

- Work can be done on `main` for non-breaking changes
- Create feature branches for experimental or breaking changes
- Document branch usage in coordination log

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass before marking tasks complete
- Run `bun run quality` after significant changes
- Document any new patterns in `.agent/docs/`
