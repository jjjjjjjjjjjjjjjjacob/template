- Watch processes refer to processes that take over the terminal (`bun run dev`, `ngrok http 80`, `tsc --watch`, `vitest`, `docker compose up`, `npx convex dev`, `bunx convex dev`)
- Do not run watch processes-- instead tell the user to run the process and provide its output.
- If you need to read output from a watched process, use timeout.
