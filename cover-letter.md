Hello Anthropic Team,

I'm writing this cover letter using Neovim & Claude Code while SSH'd into my MacBook from a treadmill. Claude Code has fundamentally changed how I build software, and I want to help make it even better.

I've used Claude Code to scale my former company and build several new applications in the past few months:

Vibechecc - A social platform where users rate life experiences. Built with TanStack Start, Convex real-time backend, and Clerk auth. I used Claude Code to implement the authentication webhooks, rating system, discovery algorithm, and responsive UI—completing what would normally take a year in under 12 weeks.

Apply-Guy - An AI-powered resume tailoring system for VC portfolio jobs. This project pushed Claude Code's capabilities: web scraping pipelines, PDF generation with React components, Convex serverless functions, and integration with multiple AI APIs. Claude Code helped me build and debug over 40 test scripts for the data pipeline alone.

I'm currently developing a Linear API integration that automatically spins up Claude Code instances for new issues/projects. When I create a Linear task, it provisions a Claude Code session with the right context, documentation, and implementation plan. This isn't just automation—it's about making AI-assisted development a natural part of the engineering workflow.

What excites me most is that I've experienced both the transformative power and current limitations of Claude Code firsthand. I know what it feels like when Claude helps you solve a complex TypeScript type issue at 2 AM, and I also know the frustration when it doesn't understand your monorepo structure. These experiences would directly inform my work on any of your teams.

My stack aligns perfectly with your needs: Full-stack TypeScript with React, Node.js, Next.js 15, and deep experience in monorepo architectures. Real-time systems using Convex, WebSockets, and server-sent events. Enterprise features like SSO integration (Clerk), role-based access, and audit logging. Infrastructure tools including Terraform, AWS, Cloudflare Workers, and Docker. AI Integration that goes beyond just using APIs to understanding how to build reliable LLM-powered features.

I've implemented enterprise-grade features like multi-tenant architectures, compliance-ready audit logs, and sophisticated permission systems. The Heat platform included SCIM-like user provisioning and granular access controls that would translate directly to your Enterprise Engineering needs.

I don't want to just use Claude—I want to shape how millions of developers will use it. Every time I run Claude Code—especially with subagents—I see the future of software development unfolding.

I'm particularly interested in the API Developer Experience and Growth Engineering teams. For API, I understand the developer journey because I live it daily—I know what makes a great SDK, what documentation actually helps, and how to build APIs that developers love. For Growth, I've been unconsciously running growth experiments on myself, discovering what makes me reach for Claude Code versus traditional development.

I'm not looking for just another engineering role. I want to work on the tools that are redefining how software gets built. My experience as a Claude Code power user, combined with my technical depth and startup mindset, would bring a unique perspective to your team.

I can start immediately and I live in New York City, but am also ready to relocate to SF if need be. More importantly, I'm ready to help build the future of AI-assisted development—one where the barrier between idea and implementation dissolves, and developers can focus on what truly matters: solving problems for users.

Best regards,  
Jacob Stein
