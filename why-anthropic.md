I want to work at Anthropic because you're taking the hardest path to build AI right.

While other companies rush to ship features, Anthropic is doing the methodical work that actually matters: constitutional AI, interpretability research, and building systems that are reliable rather than just impressive. Having spent months pushing Claude Code to its limits across three complex projects, I've seen both its remarkable capabilities and its failure modes. This dual perspective makes me deeply appreciate Anthropic's commitment to safety and reliability over flashy demos.

Your "big science" approach resonates with how I think about complex systems. When I architected the HEAT marketplace, I didn't just build features—I built a foundation that could handle real-world complexity: multi-tenant architecture, compliance requirements, financial transactions. Similarly, your research on scaling laws, constitutional AI, and interpretability isn't just academic curiosity—it's the infrastructure needed for AI systems that can be trusted in production.

What draws me most is your collaborative research culture. My most productive sessions with Claude Code happen when I treat it as a research partner, not just a coding assistant. I'll spend hours iterating on an approach, testing edge cases, and refining the implementation. This mirrors how you describe your research process: frequent discussions, empirical validation, and optimizing for long-term impact over quick wins.

I've also experienced firsthand how AI transforms when it's reliable. Claude Code changed my development workflow not because it's perfect, but because it's predictable enough to build habits around. When I SSH into my MacBook from a treadmill to fix a bug, I can do that because I trust Claude Code to maintain context and understand my codebase structure. This reliability is what enables genuine productivity gains, not just novelty.

Finally, I believe developer tools are one of AI's highest-leverage applications. Every improvement to Claude Code multiplies across every engineer who uses it. But this only works if the underlying models are trustworthy, interpretable, and aligned with human values—exactly what Anthropic is building.

I want to help bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and the practical tools that will shape how software gets built. That bridge requires both technical depth and deep user empathy—qualities I've developed through years of building complex systems and months of living with Claude Code as my primary development partner.
